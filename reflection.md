Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Elaine Chen
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? Wednesday evening
- What are your initial impressions of Java? It's a bit confusing.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? I feel that the coding is different and the format of java is different, but the overall logic of coding has some similarities.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Most parts work for me. The punctuations don't work for me. I would advice looking at java documentation and figure out possible methods that we should use.
